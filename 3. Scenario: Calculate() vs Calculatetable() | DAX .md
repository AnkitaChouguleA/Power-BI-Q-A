We have AdventureWorksDW.xlsx dataset. We have product color column with different values. we have measure called total profit from red color product. We have used Calculate function here.

The question is how you can implement same thing using CALCULATETABLE.

we can see the same value we are getting from both measure.

The only difference is that the amount of time taken by calculatetable is less than calculate. Why?
